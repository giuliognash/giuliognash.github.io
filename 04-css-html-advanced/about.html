        <p>
          I am a documentary filmmaker and freelance videographer based in New York City. I have lived in the city since 2017. I am currently a student in the Documentary program at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, where I focus on reporting through video. My work centers on civic life and public demonstrations, with a particular interest in covering protests and grassroots organizing.

          Before working in media, I served as a C-130 aircraft mechanic in the United States Air Force. That experience shaped my approach to fieldwork, preparation, and working under pressure. As a freelancer, I shoot and edit short documentaries and news features, working both independently and with newsrooms to produce clear, fact-driven visual reporting.
